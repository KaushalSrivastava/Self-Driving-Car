# Self-Driving-Car

Self Driving Car is a machine learning project and works on neural network created using Vanilla Js (No Libraries). 
This project is inspired and built upon Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor's self driving project and is modified to include self training features and other minor improvements.
