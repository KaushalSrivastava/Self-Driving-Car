# Self-Driving-Car

Self Driving Car is a machine learning project and works on neural network created using Vanilla Js (No Libraries). 
In this project I have also used code snippets from Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor's neural network project and modified to include self training features and other minor improvements.
